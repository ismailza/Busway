# Busway Ticket ChatBot - Phase 1

## Overview
The Busway Ticket ChatBot, developed during the Object Technology/IoT Workshop, aims to simplify the busway ticket reservation process. This initial phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation using Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) and MySQL to handle data management and process online reservations effectively.

## Features
- **Trip Visualization:** Enables users to browse through available trips, accessing comprehensive details about bus routes, including departure and arrival times.
- **Online Reservation:** Facilitates the online booking of tickets, streamlining the reservation process for users.
- **Dynamic Data Management:** Leverages JEE and MySQL for robust management of buses, drivers, stations, and passenger information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is designed with a focus on user experience, featuring an intuitive navigation and interaction system.
- **Chatbot**: Provides a conversational interface for users to interact with the system, making ticket booking more engaging.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Utilizes JavaServer Pages (JSP) and JavaScript for creating dynamic web pages, with Bootstrap ensuring a responsive design.
- **Backend:** Built on Java, utilizing the Jakarta EE platform for enterprise-level backend services.
- **Database:** Employs MySQL for relational data storage, managing the application's complex data needs efficiently.
- **Chatbot**: Utilizes the AIML library for creating a conversational interface, enhancing user interaction.
- **Tools:** Developed in IntelliJ IDEA, with system design and modeling supported by StarUML, and source code management facilitated through GitHub.
